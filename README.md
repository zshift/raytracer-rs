# raytracer-rs
Raytracer implementation in rust.

This was heavily inspired by https://github.com/bheisler/raytracer 
(I followed his blog posts on creating the raytracer, starting with https://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust-part-1/).
I've since added parallelism with rayon, and I'm currently working on supporting multiple color types.
